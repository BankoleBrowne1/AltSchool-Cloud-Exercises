#LINUX COMMANDS

1.	**locate** --The locate command is used to locate a file in a Linux system, it is like the search command in Windows. 
This command is useful when you don’t know where a file is saved or the actual name of the file. 
The best way to use this command is to add the “-i” command which helps to ignore the case (it doesn’t matter if it is uppercase or lowercase).
But if you want to find two words, you use the (*). E.g., locate -i *hello*Browne.
